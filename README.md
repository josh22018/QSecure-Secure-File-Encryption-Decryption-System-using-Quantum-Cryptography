# QSecure-Secure-File-Encryption-Decryption-System-using-Quantum-Cryptography
QSecure is a quantum-safe file encryption and decryption system that combines traditional and post-quantum cryptography in a user-friendly web interface. It uses AES-GCM for file encryption, with the encryption key secured using a user-selected method: RSA-OAEP, Kyber, or NTRU.
